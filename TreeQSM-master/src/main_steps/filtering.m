% FILTERING.M       Filters noise from point clouds.

% Performs an initial filtering of the point cloud.
% 
% At first the possible NaNs are removed.
% 
% Secondly those points which belong to r1-balls that have at least
% n1 points them are included. Comprehensive filtering here means that
% the r1-ball is defined for every point whereas non-comprehensive means
% that only a cover of point cloud with r1-balls is defined
%
% Lastly small components (less than n2 r2-balls) are removed.
%
% For both filtering procedures the given minimum number (n1 and n2) 
% applies for the first three meters above the ground and after that it is
% modified for each meter by the change in the mean point density. That is,
% if the point density decreases, which usually is the case, then the
% minimum number is also decreased accordingly.
%
% Inputs:
% P         Point cloud
% r1        Radius of the balls used in the first filtering
% n1        Minimum number of points in the accepted balls of the first filtering
% r2        Radius of the balls used in the second filtering
% n2        Minimum number of balls in the components passing the second filtering
% Scaling   If true, the first filtering threshold "n1" is scaled along the 
%               height with average point density
% Comp      If true, does the first filtering process for every point
%
% Outputs:
% Pass      Logical vector indicating points passing the filtering


% Default firts filtering is not comprehensive and with scaling
